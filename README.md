# Python-Project 
# Data Import and ETL Automation with Python and SQL Server
# Description
This project automates the import of CSV data into SQL Server using Python. By leveraging pyODBC and pandas, it dynamically creates tables, cleans column names for compatibility, and inserts data into the database. A graphical interface using tkinter simplifies the file selection process for end-users. This tool significantly enhances efficiency and data integrity in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks.

# Features
Automated Data Import: Python script developed using pyODBC and pandas to automate CSV data import into SQL Server, improving accuracy and speed.
Dynamic Table Creation: Automatically creates SQL Server tables based on the CSV file structure, with custom functions to clean column names for compatibility.
User Interface Integration: Tkinter is used to create a simple file selection interface, making the import process user-friendly.
